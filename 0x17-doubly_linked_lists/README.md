    How to use doubly linked lists
A linked list is better than a fixed array in C. Arrays cannot be resized, although linked list can be as big or as small as needed.
Linked list work thanks to pointers. A new structure-size chunk of memory is created, and then a series of pointers helps you fill, reference, and organize the linked list.

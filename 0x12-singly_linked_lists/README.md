0x12. C - Singly linked lists

Learning Objectives
General
      1. When and why using linked lists vs arrays  
      
    • EN ARROZ Y HABICHUELAS, PORQUE LOS LINKED LIST PESAN MAS (CANTIDAD DE BITES) QUE LOS ARRAYS. EN ESENCIAL POR LOS POINTERS. EJEMPLO
            ▪ POINTER = 2 BITES
            ▪ ARRAY = 1 BITE

Linked List
      The developer must choose the appropriate data structure for better performance. 
    • When the developer needs constant time for insertion and deletion.
    • When the data dynamically grows.
    • Insert the element in any position of the list.
    • Do not access random elements from the linked list.

Array
The array is a data structure to store the same type of elements continuously. The developer can use an array in the following use cases.
    • Need access to the elements using the index. 
    • Know the size of the array before defining the memory. 
    • Speed when iterating through all the elements in the sequence. 
    • The array takes less memory compare than a linked list.

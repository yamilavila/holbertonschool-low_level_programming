  #  What is a search algorithm
   # What is a linear search
    What is a binary search
    What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

    O(1)
    O(n)
    O(n!)
    n*m -> O(nm)
    n square -> O(n^2)
    sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
    log(n) -> O(log(n))
    n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
    …
#Tasks
#0. Linear search 
#Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm:

#    Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
    Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
    size is the number of elements in array
    And value is the value to search for
    Your function must return the first index where value is located
    If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
    Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)
```
